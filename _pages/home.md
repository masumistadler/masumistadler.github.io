Hello and welcome to my personal website. I am a biogeochemist and microbial ecologist who cares about the environment and how we as humans interact with our precious planet. I am an advocate of open science and hope to contribute in diversifying academia by being more inclusive to people of colour, LGBTQ+ folks and anyone really who may not have been born with the privileges of having access to higher education and surviving this very competitive and biased environment.
